**02 Advanced Flow Charts using loops**

Use loop statements to solve the following:
1. S(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n
2. S(n) = 1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + ... + n<sup>2</sup>
3. S(n)=1+1/2+1/3+1/4+â‹¯+ 1/n
4. T(x,n) = x<sup>n</sup> (Takes two inputs)
5. List all factors of a number
6. Count all factors of a number Factors are numbers we multiply to make a number. i.e. factors of 12 are (1,2,3,4,6,12))
7. Find greatest factor of a number (Not including itself)
8. Check if number is a square (Ie..4..16..25) If number is like 8..10.. etc output not a square. 
9. For n > 0, find first digit of n
10. Correct all flowcharts from last week
